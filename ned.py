            This model has been crafted using data sourced from car tracker, particularly Sanku’s primary fleet management tool, covering the period from **October 2023 to January 2024.** Please note that the featured geofences are as follows, offices including HQ, mills, and warehouse locations. As of now, we are working with a sample size of **5,000** entries out of a total of **21,914** entries. Due to computational limitations, we are constrained to using this sample, but we anticipate leveraging the entire dataset during the piloting and production phases.

            Our primary goal with this version 1 model is diagnostic in nature, focusing on the following objectives:
            
            - Analyzing fuel consumption to identify potential savings.
            - Evaluating time consumption to identify areas for efficiency gains.
            - Assessing per diem costs and identifying potential savings.
            - Estimating maintenance costs and identifying opportunities for cost reductions.

            Moving forward, version 2 will evolve into a predictive tool that will optimize routes for field operations teams in Tanzania, enhancing efficiency and driving cost savings.

            *The landing page for our web application will showcase the insights gleaned from this optimization model. We invite you to explore and engage with the features as we continue to refine and enhance our system to meet your operational needs.*
